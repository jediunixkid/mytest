Marcus Rating - cironian@warlords.com - 0.67a Original
Morac - mkraft@writeme.com - 0.67c 
  -Object-base Teleporter system by Jerrith the Healer (ars@nwu.edu)
  -NPC titles by Anthtracks (anthracks@gormanweb.com)
  -dungeon teleporters code by TMB (????)
  -create food and teleport spell by Cray XMP1 (binggeli@ix.netcom.com)
  -MSVC++ tile problem fix by Anthracks
  -NPC movement by Jerrith the Healer

The following by Morac(mkraft@writeme.com)
  -NPCs will chase you when attacked
  -GCC tile problem fix for GCC
  -item (corpse) decay
  -Karma/Fame
  -Murder count and Death count tracking
  -Rune renaming 
  -Spell casting and opening spellbook from macros (keyboard) 
  -NPCACTION command (see readme) by Morac
  -some bug fixes and optimizations 
  -reduced bandwidth use by replacing most call to all_items_all and all_items
   with senditem, so doesn't have to send entire item database on only 1 item change.
  -Rewrite of walking2 to take a character, not a socket as a parameter.

Jerrith - ars@nwu.edu - 0.67d
  -Rewrite of walking to take a character, not a socket as a parameter.  This
   results in the deletion of npcWalking as it is no longer needed.
  -Rewrite of teleport, to take a character, not a socket as a parameter.  NPCs can be
   teleported now.
  -Addition of the following parameters to char_st: 
                npcWander: 0=no movement, 1=follow target, 2=wander freely, 3=wander in box, 
                                   4=wander in radius
                ftarg1-4 : Serial number of target being followed for mode 1
                fx1, fy1, fz1: Point #1 for wander in box, center point for wander in radius
                fx2, fy2 : Point #2 for wander in box, fx2=radius for wander in radius, fy2 is unused.
                                   fy2 is also used in follow mode, to store range to target.  Basically,
                                   if something is following you, and you walk into a teleporter, it will 
                                   take 1 more step in the direction it last went, hoping it will end up on the
                                   teleporter as well. 
  -Function tileBlock: takes a tile number as a parameter, returns non-zero if it's
   blocking tile.
  -Function staBlock(x, y, z): takes a coordinate, returns non-zero if there is an 
   impassible static in the way.
  -Function calcSocketFromChar: takes a character index( the s, from chars[s] ) and returns 
   socket( the i from chars[currchar[i]] ).  Returns -1 if there's no match. (NPC or offline)
  -Modified mount and unmount horse to preserve NPC wandering data
  -checkBoundingBox and checkBoundingCircle functions
  -ownership and visibility variables added to item_st for upcoming features.
  -Fixes for a few misc bugs.
  -Shoving take 10 stamina

Anthracks - fred1117@tiac.net - 0.67e
  -Added functions to set the variables required by Jerrith's NPC code
        npcwandertarget() - Sets the npcWander member of char_st (set with the /NPCWANDER command)

    npccircletarget() - Sets the bounding circle for an NPC (set with the /NPCCIRCLE command)
    npcshape[] array - used to store the coords of the npc's bouding shape

Jerrith - ars@nwu.edu - 0.67f
  -Improvements to stablock.  Still not perfect, cliff avoidance is MUCH better. 
  -Implemented visibility / basic ownership:
    visible: 0=visible to all.  1=visible to owner & GMs, 2=visible to GMs only

    magic: 3=movable by owner (or someone with allmoveon) only.

  -Improvements to checkskill.  Now takes two additional parameters, low and high, the 
   skill values at which you will fail 100% of the time, and succeed 100% of the time.
  -Fully functional spellbooks.   Spellbooks will only let spell scrolls be dropped on them.
   There's a special scroll (the one after Water elemental) which will give you book ever spell.
  -Necromantic entries in spell book.  5 spells, S, R, I P, S, E.  (Speak, Raise, Ingest Poison, 
   Summon, EVIL).   They don't do anything yet, but if you get them, you can cast them by clicking
   where their icon would be in the book.  They aren't indexed either, just go to the end of the book.
  -Removal of scroll item types.  Scrolls now cast their spell, if they have the code to do it, based
   on their ID.

  -NPC add scripts now let you set NPCWANDER, FX1, FX2, FY1, FY2, FZ1
  -NPC 1 (whoever the orc) changed to wander mode 2 by default.

Jerrith - ars@nwu.edu 0.67t
  -Fixed bug in deathstuff regarding deleting of corpses that don't exist.
  -Fixed bug that prevented containers from being placed on corpses. (deathstuff)
  -Note, to clean up world files that are buggy because of this bug, you'll
	 need to kill each character who has ever died.  This should also hopefully 
	 fix the problem where a player had a full spellbook, but couldn't cast any 
	 spells from it.  (You can also just delete characters, and make everyone recreate.)

  -Added "Removing item" message to removetarget.

   the respawn to wait, and set morez to the maximum # of minutes. 
  -Widened the z range of object teleporters.  Should work with more items now.

Morac - mkraft@writeme.com 0.67u

   keywords in the script file:  STR, DEX, INT, STRENGTH, DEXTERITY, INTELLIGENCE

  -/movetobag and /dupe by Ashran.

   that many of the NPC in morex. (100 orcs in LB's courtyard is fun.:) )
  -Note the itemmenus added to the script file.  These are required for alchemy to work.

Tal Strake - tal@gdi.net 0.67.027 
  -Added in item enchantment type 18

Jerrith - ars@nwu.edu 0.67.028

   current code to have its added features.

  -/newz now works on characters as well.

Krozy - krozy@axiomstudios.com 0.67.029
  -Added Random NPC Spawning
   A mock NPC must be added to the uox3.scp file (This is due to the way the npc
   spawnpoint type (62) uses the morex value).  The name property of this npc must
   be set to 'RANDOMNPC' (without the quotes).  It is case sensitive.
  -Added NPCLIST property to NPCs.
   This property is ignored if the NPC is not used for random spawning.
   It is required if NPC NAME is set to 'RANDOMNPC'.  The value is a reference to
   the NPC List to use.
  -Added NPCLIST section.
     This section contains a list of all NPCs that may be spawned.  One NPC within
     this list will be randomly chosen.
  -Added Random NPC Naming for Spawned NPCs.
   Random NPC names are useful for male and female npc humans, as well as named
   monsters such as lizardmen, orcs, ratmen, deamons, etc.  Set the NAME property
   of an NPC to 'RANDOM' (without quotes).  It is case sensitive.
  -Added NAMELIST property to NPCs
   This property is ignored if the NPC name is not set to 'RANDOM'.
   It is required if NPC NAME is set to 'RANDOM'.  The value is a reference to
   the NPC Name list to use.
  -Added RANDOMNAME section
     This section contains a list of all the names to be used by any NPC that is
     spawned with a name of RANDOM using this list.
  -Added LOOT property for Spawned NPCs
   When present, the value of the LOOT property is a reference to the LOOTLIST
   to pick a random item that will be added to the NPC.  Sample Syntax:
  -Added LOOTLIST section
     This section contains a list of items defined in the script.  One item will
     be randomly chosen to be added to the NPC.
  -Added GOLD property for Spawned NPCs.
   When present, a random amount of gold will be added as loot for this npc.  The
   value of this property is used as the max.  The internal formula is:
   amount = randomnumber between GOLD/2 and GOLD. (a value of 300 can yeild 150-300).
  -Added the /GOPAGE command.
   This command teleports a GM to the origin of the most recent page.  More handy
   then typing a /gochar 00 00 00 06, but rather limited in abilities.
  -Added crystal ball prophecies (ok, they werent in demand, they aren't in UO, but
   I just had to add them after all the bitching that goes on about them not doing
   a damn thing in UO :)

Jerrith - ars@nwu.edu 0.67.030
  -Shortened Krozy's 0.67.029 update listing.  This file is not the place for
   script examples, it's already long enough.
  -Fixed dungeon lighting bug.
  -Potion info is now stored in morex, morey, and morez on the potion.
  -Wrote function impowncreate, replaces the owncreate and wornitem messages with
   one more efficient owncreate, needed for shopkeepers.
  -Rewrite of read2 and readscript, and changes to str2num to (hopefully) prevent
   script crashes.
  -Changed crystal ball code to work on objects set to type 18 instead of just
   crystal ball objects.  Changed some messages to be more generic as a result.
  -Added functionality to GOLD tag.  If you specify one number, it works the same
   as before.  Specify two numbers, and you are saying the min amount, and the 
   max amount.  (GOLD 150 200) would generate between 150 and 200 gold.
  -You no longer need to specify RANDOM or RANDOMNPC to get the random name or
   random npc effect, just add appropriate NAMELIST or NPCLIST tag.
  -NPC declarations can now be recursive.  The simple example is, setup a random
   NPC. After the NPCLIST tag, put in the normal things you want, overriding the
   random npc's values.  This can be used to do say, a random npc, and the same
   random npc who always carries 2000 gold, in addition.
  -deathstuff and resurrection handling of items rewritten to prevent having
   multiple layer 0 objects on a character.
  -Some cleanup on the above mentioned function areas.
  -Beginnings of code for recursive items.
  
Missing from original 0.67.030 update file, but present:
  -BACKPACK tag for NPCs in scripts.  Give the NPC a BACKPACK for his loot and gold.
  -PACKITEM tag for NPCS in scripts.  If the item isn't something that is being
   equipped (weapon, armor, clothing), create it with PACKITEM instead of ITEM.

Anthracks - fred1117@tiac.net 0.67.031
  -Updated the GM paging system to be a bit more like that of UO's

    -GM's can view the queue with the /q command

     player and their call will be removed from the queue.    
    -Also, you can now enter the problem description yourself if you choose "Other" on the menu.
  -You can now start commands with a . as well as a / (don't worry I made it so you can still                   type "..." if you want; someone was griping about that :)
  -Removed Krozy's GM code as this new one made it somewhat redundant (sorry Krozy).
  -Added /time command to show the current UO time

Jerrith - ars@nwu.edu 0.67.032
  -Added Zarn's improved code for multitarget and checkkey using switches to

   xy positions in packs.
  -BACKPACK tracking in monster spawning has improved, no duplicate packs.
  -Gold spawned with the GOLD tag will now decay.

   with UNRELEASED.

  -/STAMINA command by Krozy.  Click on the character to refresh.
  -Added value to item_st.
  -/makeshop command to add shopkeeper buy containers to a NPC.
  -Quick shop test/demo instructions.  Make a jar of honey (0x09EC), Make a NPC, 
   use /makeshop on the NPC, use /gmopen 1A on the NPC.  Put the jar of honey in
   the container that opens.  Close the container, use the command /testtarget, 
   and click on the NPC.

Ashran - amir@tirol.com 0.67.033
  -Added a parser for commands: look at the void response(int s) for more
   information. 
  -Added npc response to commands:  If you own a npc use the commands like in UO.
   Working at this time are: pet release, pet attack/kill, pet follow, pet
   follow me, pet stop, and pet transfer.  All other commans are checked but
   have no code.

Jerrith - ars@nwu.edu 0.67.034

  -Items put in the container opened by /gmopen 1a on a npc shopkeeper will 
   automatically restock over time.  Items put in the container opened by
   /gmopen 1b will never restock.
  -New script tags for NPCs:
   -SHOPKEEPER - Give them the containers they need to be a shopkeeper.
   -RSHOPITEM #- A shop item that will respawn. (fill in # like for ITEM or PACKITEM)
   -SHOPITEM #- A shop item that will not respawn.
  -New script tags for Items:
   -VALUE - Set the price/value of an item.
   -RESTOCK - Set the number of restocks this starts with.  (Basically, you could 
    setup a shop to start with 10 of something, and 10 restocks, and it would 
	gradually work up to having 20 of the item in stock, but wouldn't instantly.)
  -Object teleporter collision detection fix by Krozy. (krozy@axiomstudios.com)
  -New sendbpitem code by Morac (mkraft@writeme.com)
  -You can say any of the following words to get a shopkeeper's attention: vendor,
   shopkeeper, npc.  Include "buy" in the same line of text, and he will open 
   his shop window.  (Just say "vendor buy" or "npc buy", etc.)

  -Added selling to NPC shopkeepers.  Use vendor sell, instead of vendor buy, etc,
   or the /sell command to use one.  Items in the container at /gmopen 1C are the
   items the vendor will consider buying.  He will offer the price the item in 
   the 1C container has as its value.
   -Note: Only items in your main pack will be checked to see if the vendor will
    buy them, and only the first 75 he will consider buying will be displayed.
  -Added SELLITEM tag for scripts.  NPCs will put this item in their 1C sell 
   containers.  Note, the value of the object is automatically divided by two.
   (So if you put the same item in the buy and sell bags, the npc will by

Jerrith - ars@nwu.edu 0.67.039

  -/tradetest.  Test of bringing up the trade system.  Doesn't work yet, be sure
   to close it before walking away from the NPC you opened it on. :)
  -Monster NPCs should no longer attack logged out players. 
  -Added Krozy's improved code for corpses.
  -Fixed alchemy bug where canceling would display the not enough reagents message.

  -Doing /cstats will automatically open the status window for the character.
  -added Basic potion use.  
  -/tradetest and /gumpopen testing commands....
  -calcValue function designed to handle price/value modifiers for objects.  
   Basically, any object should be assigned it's value as if it were normal, 
   nonmagical, and the price change should be calculated in calcValue.

Anthracks - fred1117@tiac.net 0.67.040
  -Further updates to GM/Counselor paging system.
   -Added a Counselor queue to go along with the GM one.
   -Added /jail and /release commands for Counselors and GM's.
   -When in jail prisoners cannot cast magic and cannot talk to others in jail.
   -Added /gotocur command to teleport you to the player who paged you should they leave while
    you are talking to them.
   -Added /clear command. Now, your current call remains in the queue until you /clear it or.
    go to the next call with /next.
   -Added /gmtransfer command for Counselors. If a counselor goes to a call and feels it needs
    to be handled by a GM then this command will transfer the call to the GM queue.
  -Reorganized some of the commands. Now Counselors can only use /next, /clear, /q, /jail,
   /release, /gotocur, /cstats, /istats, /goplace and /gmtransfer.
  -Enhanced /addnpc command. Now if you give it just one number, it will add the npc of that
   number from the script.
  -Updated the GMMENU sections of the .scp file (included is the Script Team's 0.14 script).
  -Added Secure Trading windows, the ones that pop up when you give another player an item.
   By Jerrith (ars@nwu.edu).

Maytrix - maytrix@uox3.com 0.67.041
  -Updated combat to use new function combat()
  -added SWORDSMANSHIP check to combat
  -added TACTICS check to combat (causes more damage if skill is used up to a max of 10)

Jerrith - ars@nwu.edu 0.67.042
  -Added 0.67.041 information to update file.
  -Removed notes on secure trading from goldkey.h (Oops!) :)
  -New UOX3 file, regions.scp.  Use this combination script/ini file to specify in game
   regions, and their properties.  See sample included file.  Note, in this release, 
   regional weather is not yet implemented, and guards are not summoned in guarded 
   areas...   Those features are coming soon. :)
  -Sample regions.scp file provided by Anthracks. (fred1117@tiac.net)
  -Dropping an item on a NPC no longer brings up the secure trading window.
  -Removed Maytrix's 0.67.041 combat code changes.  Code is both incorrect, as 
   not all weapons use swordsmanship, and tactics does not add a damage bonus, and
   also buggy, as it adds a character's index to it's chance of hitting. (Basically, the
   200th monster in the game, regardless of it's dex, would hit 100% of the time.)
  -Removed Maytrix's 0.67.041 deathstuff fix by Krozy.  Krozy and I had talked and agreed
   the fix he posted would not actually work correctly all the time.
  -New deathstuff fix to cut down on lag caused by deaths, written by myself and Krozy.
  -Removed Maytrix's 0.67.041 skill and stat increase changes.  Again, bugs and incorrectly
   implemented features.  Stats should not go down when a skill fails, no advancement curve
   present at all from 50.0 skill to 100.0 skill, current hp, mana, and stamina can rise
   above maximum, skill and stats increase delay timers are not present in UO and a bad idea
   as well.
  -Added bug fix to checkskill function so that it will correctly update the client's 
   display of skills when a skill under 30.0 increases on a failed attempt of use.
  -Fixed bug in skill delay not being initialized for characters.  Could prevent a 
   character from ever using skills.

Jerrith - ars@nwu.edu 0.67.043
  -Bug fix to fix region display on startup.
  -Combat now checks Tactics for a hit 50% of the time, and Swordsmanship 50% of 
   the time (basically what it does in UO for sword weapons...)  Skill check 
   difficulty varies based on opponents tactics score.  Two GM tactics people
   would hit each other roughly every 2 out of 3 swings.
  -NPC skills can now be set in the script file.  SKILL # AMOUNT.  So for say,
   tactics, SKILL 27 1000 for 100.0 tactics.  uox3.h has a list of the skills and
   their numbers.
  -Blacksmithing changed to subtract appropriate amounts of ingots.  Set with 
   INGOTS in blacksmithing script file.
  -Skill needed to smith an item now set in the script with MINSKILL MAXSKILL, 
   the skill you will always fail at, and the skill you should always succeed at.
  -Updated uox3.bss to use new parameters.
  -Summoned monsters are weaker, but now have tactics, swordsmanship, and 
   magic resistance skill scores.
  -Fixed bug causing corpse update problem on the death of monsters.
  -/kick command works again.
  -Added all shovels, pickaxes, and smithing tools to doubleclick, written by
   Krozy.
  -Added new UOX file, skills.scp.  Use this to specify skill and stat advancement
   curves.  Values after SKILLPOINT are: #1 base skill this curve point takes effect
   at, #2 skill gain for a success, #3, skill gain for a failure.  failure value
   is not use for stat advancement.
  -Default skills.scp by Anthracks.
  -New checkskill function and subfunctions to handle skill advancement.

Morac - mkraft@writeme.com 0.67.044
  -There are a lot of changes in here (and I mean a lot), I recommend moving your stuff into
   this uox3.cpp instead of other way around when updating so you don't miss anything.
  -If adding an item with "/add h1 h2" and the item is stackable it will be now.
  -Pileable items no longer have to be marked with "PILE" in script. the pileable status
   is taken from the verdata.mul file.
  -Items layer are set to 0, when item is not being created and worn on npc/player.
  -Game now checks when you walk into a firefield or paralyze field
  -Sped up searching for characters and items.  You probably won't see the
   difference unless you have a lot of items and/or characters.
  -Formatted code so it is easier to read.
  -Changed "uox3.bss" to "create.scp" as it will soon contain more than just blacksmithy.
   Changed menuitems to MAKEMENUITEM, changed smithmenu to makemenu and smithmenutarget to
   make menutarget. They both take an additional parameter which is the SKILL that's making
   the item. Left alchemy the way it is cause it had delays and other complicated stuff.
  -Change SMITHMENUOFFSET to MAKEMENUOFFSET and increased it to 2048 because the MENUITEM's
   in the script file were approaching 1024 and potions overlapped it.
  -I took the items out of the "uox3.scp" and put them in "items.scp". This
   should noticeably speed up menu processing for items (since they were at the 
   end of the uox3.scp file).
  -Removed items from create.scp, now all menus there point to items in items.scp. Also
   MAKEMENUs now contain a RESOURCE and SKILL. RESOURCE is how many of ingots/wood/ect. the
   player needs and SKILL is the minimum skill required to make the item. Max is set a
   3x min. choice and makemenu were modified to only show items you can make with your
   current resources and skills.
  -Skills shown in skill window are now the baseskills plus stat modifiers. Both baseskills
   and stat modified skills tracked.
  -Fixed make GM and Make counselor.  They would only add GM or Counselor if you already
   had one in your name. Also set priv2 so you can do GM things.
  -Skills list and status window updated when set with "/SET" command
  -NPCs no longer walk through (or over) walls, doors and other dynamic objects.
  -NPCs will open doors.
  -NPCs will now attempt to go around objects when blocked while following/chasing player.
  -You can no longer use items equipped by other players.
  -Gold in status window is updated when added or removed from your pack.
  -Fixed a minor bug in advance skils and stats which would cause skill/stats to go over 100.
  -Fixed skills.scp so it matches current OSI skill percentages. 
  -Tactics should NOT affect chance to hit (it hasn't been this way since Nov 97),
   It is a damage modifier. I adjusted that.
   (Note the Origon's Official guide is hopelessly out of date, you uoss.stratics.com for stats).

Anthracks - fred1117@tiac.net 0.67.045
  -Implemented Healing/Veterinary, use scissors on cloth to make bandage and use the bandage
   to heal.
  -Possible fix for people crashing when they talk.

  -Changed the value of the z npc's were restricted to from 2 to 5 (Jerrith).

  -/setamount2 command. things like bolts of cloth use this value to track how many yards are
   left.
  -Default gold and starting privlidges in the .ini!
    After the heartbeat line, the next line should be the amount of gold to start with, then
    the next 2 are the devault privs, priv1 and priv2.

  *Fix for spirit speak causing server crash at startup by Anthracks.
  *Fix for /jail and /release commands by Anthracks (fred1117@tiac.net).
  -New "/fullstats" command, wich will refresh mana, stamina and HPs to max.
   This command does not have any animation or sound, like "/mana", as I
   don't think a GM needs that.
  -Implementation of first *basic* version of Special Attack Attribute.
   Use "/setspattack 1" to set special attack to Phisical Fireball, wich
   makes Remaining HPs/10 Damage(a Dragon with 450hp would make 45 damage).

* This 2 fixes were included on 45a but not commented.

TANiS tanis@mediacom.it 0.68.015 - RETIRED! -
 - Added some typecasting to avoid warnings and bugs in almost every function
 - Should compile fine under LINUX

TANiS tanis@mediacom.it 0.68.016
 - Version 0.68.015 was bugged and therefore retired.
 - This one has the same enhancements to the main code as v0.68.015
   but it's working fine with no lock-ups or world deletion.
 - The code is now clear from wrong typecasting and stuff like that
   and should be a good base to work with expecially when developing
   under Linux. 
 - Please use this code as the base for further working on the code
   because I've done some clean-up here and there throughout all the
   25000+ lines of code!

Krozy krozy@questworld.ml.org 0.68.017
 - Compiled by Krozy, Jim (jim_coh@hotmail.com), Polaris (harrison@erim-int.com)
 - Reverted back to 0.68.014 for the base. (Both 68015 & 68016 caused problems for myself
   and several others trying to use it.  I could not successfully get the code to run on
   either version.  Version 68015 is null as 68016 replaces it.  Since the changes to
   68016 were some kind of typecasting which seems to be unecessary as it worked on linux
   prior to this, I felt it best to revert.  If anyone has anything to say on behalf of
   68016, please consult me (Lucas Moten - krozy@questworld.ml.org - ICQ:3826730).
 - Introduction of Townstones (Phase 1) (Items 0EDD & 0EDE)
   Features & Documentation included in townstones.txt
 - Hair Dye with color of your choice (use color dyes on hair dye bottle, then use hair dye).
 - GM see all players (even logged out ones) functionality.  Useful for modifying (fixing)
   players who have logged out.  Players who are logged out get '(OFF)' appended to allname.

   will be a more appropriate name for future coding.
 - Put in a fix to void backpack code that will show items that may have been previously
   out of range to be displayed.  Players who 'lost' items may now get them back, and there
   may be some items that finally show up that were of the world 'lost long ago'.  GMs should
   be alert from this patch for calls made referring to odd objects in player packs.  This
   is a quickie fix.
 - Modified savenewworld function to display on the console when an automatic save is performed.
   Also made it broadcast a system message to logged on players 'System: World Saving', and
   'System: World Saved'.
 - Linux Compile line: gcc -w -lm -funsigned-char -ouox3 uox3.cpp im.cpp

   in the game.
  -Cause mining doesn't check for mountains I put in the 1 for 1 fix Friend put in 17a.
  -Put in "proper" daemon summoning fix by Friend
  -Summoned creatures stronger fix by Friend. Actually summoned monsters should
   come from npc file, but I'm not doing that now :)

  -Added newbie items when a char is created
  -Only file modified are globals.cpp, uox3.cpp, uox3.h
  -Added new script file, newbie.scp, can be customized by adding more PACKITEMS under each skill section
  -Anything new added is mark with newbie in some way
  -The only known bug is if PARRYING is set as the highest skill when creating a new char, it causes no items togo into the new chars pack
    I suggest not to set it as the highest skill,  if you set it as the secong or third it works fine.
    I have no idea why this happens but I'll try to fix it soon.
    Email me if you fing out why or how to fix it.
  -Read the Newbie.txt

Friend(Brother Kane) - 0.68.025.008 - Tailoring

  - Added tailoring skill and now one can enjoy making clothing and leather armor
  - Now how this works

		-  First of all you need to kill some animals for either hides or wool,
		   or you can possibly buy some cloth from a local tailor or some 
		   hides from the tanner.
		-  When you get wool, you will need to find the nearest spinning wheel(all 
               are defined) and spin some yarn.
		-  Take the yarn and goto the nearest Loom and make your cloth.
		-  In order to produce clothing, you will need a set of knitting tools.
		-  When you knit your clothing it will bring up a menu to show what your able
               to make based on your tailoring skill.
		-  I also include cotton as a resource to make cloth. You will use the spinning wheel
               for this also and it will produce thread instead of yarn.  Works the same way.
		-  I am working on making a new resorce(Cotton fields to get cotton from) Like
               how lumberjack works.

  - Leather Amour

		- You will have to again kill your game(as in animal) that produces hides, and then take your
		  sewing kit to bring up a menu to make the product.  This is also based on tailoring skill.

  - Fixed the bandage thing to make it more realistic

		- Added sounds to sissors to make it sound like your cuting them.
		- Made bandages stackable
        	- Set Tailoring skill to it.

  - A few more notes:

		- Make sure you have the needed create.scp to make this all happen or you'll crash.
		- I'll be working more on tailoring to finish it up, but this is a start.
		- Also I might not have the exact ratio correct but that is easy to change just let
		  me know.
		- Also have started into Cooking and Baking skill. What works in cooking is taking meat and making ribs on a campfire.
		- It is almost done.

Friend(Brother Kane) - 0.68.025.008b - Tailoring

	- Fixed the bug with hides not being consumed
	- I added some more cooking:
		- The only thing I have done is making pizza, hehe wasn't going to release put i am not taking it out 
		  and put it back in.
		- You have you create sausages and a bag of flour(not right just testing) and use
		  sausage on clour to make pizza, then create a stove and bake it on(not all stoves are 
		  included since i am not done yet.  But the bags of flour are openable and closable. ;)

	- added the left out bandage fix from last update.
	- can't think of any more , Just play around and have fun!
McCleod - 0.68.025.009 - Custom Titles

- fix for the War Axe returning swordsmanship rather than macefighting
- combat animations for on and off horses & depending on weapon held by character
- sphere of influence: calculated radius, only calculated around 
  logged in players, helping performance. did not change this to dynamic yet.
  it is a virtual circle around players, if an NPC is within they are
  then "processed" for movement otherwise they are not. the radius variable
  is set in the npcmovement function.
- change in worlddarklevel and worldbrightlevel to a more acceptable level.
- slight change in main function from sleep(20) to sleep(50): 
  allowing the server some needed breathing time.
- included the new MASTERKEY for version 1.25.35 (by DasRaetsel, seek@mfn.de) (thanks!)

-fix for combat miss generated arrows and bolts not decaying
-sound effect for arrow misses should now work correctly
-revamp of magery damages, both npc and pc, using a more unified formula thats easy to
tweak, along with formula made lots of needed damage changes.(I plan on fine tuning damage
after i recieve some input from shards).

Tao - 0.68.025.012 (kolourz@gte.net)
-optimized sphere of influence loop-checking
-fix: monsters now 'wander freely' when in the player's
 sphere of influence.
-modularized/randomized combatonfoot & combatonhorse:
	combatonfoot now plays more than one combat animation
	for the appropiate weapon type held by player.
	combatonhorse was just modularized as there seems to
	only be one good animation depending on weapon.
-combat.cpp: with the new modularized combat animation
 functions only these functions need to be called to play an
 animation combat sequence.
-fix: replaced a combat message.
-tweaked the main's sleep function in the loop to 40 (from
 50) as a some reported a slight jerkyness on lowbandwidth
 connections to the server.
-i did not inline (_inline) any functions. therefore, it is
 up to the dude (or dudete) who compiles the code to deceide
 what to and not to inline, depending on their coding style.

SpaceDog - 068.025.012a
- compiled the souce from 068.025.12

- Fixed client crash bug in impowncreate()

- Added Teleporting Guards code (NPCAI 0x40)
- Fixed walking() to avoid stall if bad parameters are passed to function seekmulti()
- Fixed pile amount count bug in pack_item()
- Fixed checktempeffects() to avoid bad characters numbers. This avoid a lot of instances of
  character data corruption and should fix some of the trading troubles.

TANiS - 0.68.025.014a (tanis@mediacom.it)
- Fixed division by zero bug when fighting with bare hands.

TANiS - 0.68.025.015 (tanis@mediacom.it)
- Added Logging Functions for hunting bugs LogMessage, LogWarning, LogCritical (use them! :))
- Added performance profiling. Press 'P' to see some stats from the console. (Not working under
  LINUX yet)
- Added "who" ('W' key from the console) to see who's logged on.
- A note: NPCAITYPE 0x40 is RESERVED for teleporting guards. Do not add any npc with such
  NPCAITYPE because it would get removed instantly. Teleporting Guard are still being worked on
  so if you need standard guards use NPCAITYPE 0x04 instead.
- Reformatted combat() section to make it readable
- Added two new files debug.cpp and debug.h
- Fixed makemenutarget() to take into account HIDAMAGE, LODAMAGE, DAMAGE&ATT, skill level of

Friend(Brother Kane) - 0.68.025.016 - Cannons/And some addons

- I have added the cannon code into this: 
- First of all you need to create a cannon
- Next all you need to do is load it( Load the cannon by simply dbl clicking on the cannon
ball (0e 73), and it will ask you what cannon to load. Then just click on cannon. 
-Well, the cannon damage is based on your tactics skill. Since their is no cannon skill. ;(
You can dodge the cannon ball if your parry is high enough(kind of like magic resist.
-  Ok if you want to make a cannon from scratch this is what you have to do:

	-  You need atleast a 700+ skill in smithy and have 250 ingots.
	- When you finally  make a cannon, you'll recieve a cannon deed in your backpack.
	- The you have to place it somewhere, sell it, or place in a safe place(bank).
		- Just simply dbl click on the deed and click the place you want to place it.
		- I have added this all in the items and create script file.  Make sure you have it in your dir!  
		- Ohh forgot, yes you can make cannon balls too!  I think I have them set at 10 ingots each! ;)
- Alot more to it, but i am releaseing this fast because people wanted it, and i want to get back
to more coding. Thanks! 
- Now when you cook your raw ribes on the fire, you get cooked ribs, NOW YOU CAN EAT THEM! Cooking skill also!
- Some of my cooking is in here also! Finishing the rest! Alot of Ingreds! 
- Also when you make a bag of flour it is openable and closable! Also added some items usable in here
by dbl clicking on it. Just a sample! 
Well this is all for now! Like I said I have been down with the Flu, and feel like crap, so i put
this in fast, and trying to fig out the Static maving effect from an onject, if you can help me, I would be very happy! 
Thanks!

TANiS (tanis@mediacom.it) - 0.68.025.016a

UOX3 v0.68.025.019 by Sir Joseph (sirjoseph@dzonline.com) - 10/3/98

Fixes:
 - Fix for Gates (hehe check your code after merging it, Vagrant :)
 - Fix for getting the wrong message by drinking a cure potion if you were not poisoned
 - "Vendor Sell" client lock-ups should no longer happen
   * Feedback needed on this one :)
 - Fix for Inscription, Alchemy (by Bud)
 - Put the right sound on the Lizardman with spear, (it was supposed to be fixed in version 025018 but I forgot there was 2 switch(id2) in void playmonstersound .... sorry Sir_Joseph, by SpaceDog)
 - Added minecheck fix (by Vagrant)
 - Fix for Newbie items not being stackble (by Vagrant)
 - Mining regions can now be placed within other regions (by Vagrant)
 - Fix for the miner paperdoll crash (by Anthracks)

Modified stuff:
 - Magery tweaked, changed: Harm, Fireball, Lightning, Energy bolt, Explosion and Flamestrike damage, better # of HPs healed
   calculation for Greater Heal
   * I need some feedback on this one too :P
 - Commented out the "UOX3: Sendbpitem bug. Item not in container." message as it was very annoying :)
 - "Townstone" now uses type 35 instead of an ID
 - Defender no longer learns attacker's combat skill. I commented out this as it was a "kinda ugly learn-from watching wannabe feature" IMHO ;)
 - Changed the ingots HEX from 1B EF to 1B F2 looks nicer when they pile (by SpaceDog)
 - Changed poison text, sow that it now shows with red text when you have been poisoned (by SpaceDog)

New stuff:
 - New Fame/Karma gain system, more like OSIs. This way it should be much harder to raise your reputation to high levels.
   (no more Glorious Lords from killing rats :P)
   * SCRIPT WRITERS NEED TO UPDATE NPC.SCP. A Lich Lord, for example, should have around 12000 Karma/fame
   * And more feedback needed here! :)
 - Damage Objects (type 85), every time a character walks over one of this (includes changing direction for now), it will
   make "item[x]+a random number between item[y] and item[z] damage". Example, place a flamestrike animation object on ground,
   /settype 85 on it and /setmorexyz 10 10 25. This will make 20-35 damage every time a character walks thru it.
 - Added "poisontxt" timer, so the poison message won't spam
 - Added some basic teleport check, you now cannot teleport to static blocking tiles (ie walls) unless you are a GM
 - Item use timer (delay, "You must wait to perform another action.", does not apply for GMs)

   (defined on server.scp, COMBAT_HIT_MESSAGE 0 is off, 1 is on)
 - Added new Tailoring function (by Vagrant)
 - Added goldmining back in code, this was left out since version 025.007 (made by Hunter, added by SpaceDog)
 - Changed gold ore a gold color insted of ordinary iron ore color :) (by SpaceDog)
 - You can now mine cave walls too :) (by SpaceDog)
 - Made more items created from code decay "I actually think we are lucky if the code doesn't decay now :)" (by SpaceDog & Bud)
 - Alchemy now creates an empty bottle :) (by Bud)

Script stuff:
NPC.SCP
 - Changed the City Guards to use SECTION NPC 1000 & 1001, so if you use another script then The Script Teams you don't have to alter it, just add NPC 1000 & 1001 and set npcai to 4 (by SpaceDog)

 - Piles of scrolls no longer disappear when you double click to use one
 - Same with all food items
 - mana gets used in one spot instead of 65 (deleted 320 lines of code!)
 - Fixed teleporting guard code. Thanks Dupois!
 - Added a fix for teleporting guards AI (TANiS)
 - Added a fix for checktempeffect() for trying to apply the effect to dead people and corrupting memory (TANiS)

 - Added ability to cook an lots of different things, ovens, fires, etc... (CyberCrusher)
 
 
Modified stuff:  (sorry I don't know who all the credit goes to for these)

 - Added in the arrow stacking during combat snippet
 - Added in the shutdown message in minutes snippet
 
Thanks to Swords for helping test out guards...this is what we found:
*** Teleporting guards will attack the aggressor.*** Period end of story. Regardless of if you attack a monster or not,in town of course.
Also when monsters are chasing into town guards will not teleport in to save you unless the monster "re-aquires" you
Guards don't seem to teleport out of town anymore.

That about does it so far....

UOX3 v0.68.025.021 by Cironian
Routines affected:
 - uox3.cpp
 - uox3.h

Done:
 - Fixed updatechar not to break the walk counter anymore
 - Changed wear_item to fix paperdoll items vanishing on equip
 - Small changes to teleport for a similiar reason (New client "feature")
 - Same for startchar...
 - Added another advancement object type (81) which ALWAYS allows usage
   (Dont place this one in public areas, its for shard personel only! :)

=============================================================================================================================================

UOX3 v0.68.025.022 by TANiS (tanis@mediacom.it)

Files modified:
 - list.h is NO LONGER NEEDED! It's been so for months but it's still getting around. Please
   don't add it back.

Fixed:
 - Backpack bug. When dropping items with a serial number >=0x41000000 the server would crash.
   I modified the check on the item serial number and now it works ok.
 - dump_item() function now handles wrong serial numbers the right way and doesn't corrupt the
   items database.
 - Doors are now auto-closing again.
 - setspeechtarget() function now works correctly and allows you to set a speech to basic npcs
   in orded to let them work as vendors (vendors aren't working if you don't set a speech for
   them)
 - "stamina" is misspelled into "stanima" in some server functions. Corrected.
 - I had to comment out a section in npcMovement() because it was forcing NPCs to have
   NPCWANDER set to 2.

Added:
 - You can now define in SERVER.SCP if monsters should attack animals. To let them attack
   animals define MONSTERS_VS_ANIMALS to 1
   This way there's a chance that monsters will attack animals. This chance can be defined
   in SERVER.SCP as ANIMALS_ATTACK_CHANCE. By default it's set to 15% chance to attack an
   animal.
   By default MONSTERS_VS_ANIMALS is set to 0 and this means monsters won't attack animals
   at all.
   Actually monsters won't attack vendors and the like because the check is made on the npcai
   and since npcai is set to 0x00 for both animals and vendors/npcs monsters won't attack them.
   I'm still trying to find a way to identify animals from other npcs. If anybody has got an
   idea please let me know.
   Thanks to Kolours and Spacedog for hints.

To do by Script Writers:
 - Add all the missing menus in CREATE.SCP

UOX3 v0.68.025.024 released by Sir Joseph <sirjoseph@dzonline.com> - 10/11/98
Fixes/New Features/Modifications done by Sir Joseph, Gerry, Dupois, Vagrant, Anthracks and Jim Wright.

Fixes:
  - "SKILLx 1" lines are no longer saved(WSC). This should save up some space :)

  - Fix for Res Robes not decaying
  - Some fix for Guards :)
  - Correct light type for Gates
  - Fix for incorrect characters getting food messages

  - Alchemy fix (by SpaceDog/Gerry)
  - Fix for Fish decay (by Bud)
  - Fix for Combat Message (by Bud)
  - Fixed problem with cloth not being used when making bandages (by Vagrant)
  - Fixed tailoring finally. It now uses the correct amount of cloth or hides (by Vagrant)

Modified Stuff:
  - Re-activated house deeds. They are *STILL* Buggy. If you don't like em, just don't use em :)
  - "combat target clean" is now done at deathstuff()
  - Better "combat attack" AI, fixes, etc (modified various combat internal stuff, like attacker not following target, etc :)
    (new function used, npcsimpleattacktarget)

  - Merged walking() and npcwalking(): Just added a check to see whether it was an npc or not, got rid of 531 lines of unnecissary code (By Vagrant)

New Features:
  - You can no longer cast spells while frozen
  - NPCs will now flee if they are about to die, and reload old wander mode if they regenerate some health
    This uses 2 new script commands for npc.scp: FLEEAT and REATTACKAT, for example, you can set FLEEAT at 30 and that NPC would flee from target 
    when it reaches %30 health, and REATTACKAT 60 to make it re-attack("reload" old wander mode) when it reaches %60 health. If you want to make a
    char never flee, set FLEEAT -1 and REATTACKAT 0. If nothing is set then default values are used (defined at server.scp), check Script file modifications.
    Thanks a lot to Moongraven and Vagrant for helping me fix a problem I had with this :)
  - New command: /SETHEXMOREXYZ
  - Sound Objects(type 86). When a player walks into one of this, there is a chance of [item morez]% that the sound
    [item morex] [item morey] will be played. Example: Item type 86, MoreXYZ: 01 9c 80, there is a chance of %80 that the sound
    of a lich laughing will be played when the player walks over this item. (Use /SETHEXMOREXYZ to set the sound ID and then
    use /SETMOREZ for the chance)
  - New item limit of 32768
  - Karma/Fame gain is now capped at 1000 per kill
  - New door sounds (by Dupois)
  - Sound for createpotion() (by Dupois)
  - New item SFXs, for example, gold dropping, moving objects, etc (by Dupois)

  - Implemented shaft carving and bowcraft (by Vagrant)
  - New Advancement Object script features(lines): DYEHAIR, DYEBEARD, KILLHAIR, KILLBEARD, KILLPACK, ITEM, SKIN, POLY, ADVOBJ (by Anthracks)

Script Files:
  - New teleport.scp file
  - Lots of work done on npc.scp, "rich, almost-invulnerable" wisps, drakes/dragons firing every 50 seconds, reapers using magery every 100..
    eles casting 3 magic arrows and running out of mana, almost all magery-using monsters casting every 10 seconds,
    hyper-weak monsters like bone knights..etc etc, all fixed/changed :)
  - Added fletching/bowcraft stuff to create.scp and items.scp, it's all outlined in DOCS\scp_changes_UOX3_068_025_024.txt (by Vagrant)

UOX3 v0.68.025.027a released by Genesis <kccarter@uswest.net> - 11/05/98

Fixes, Modifications and New Features in this release were done by:
	Genesis

Fixes:

- Addmenutarget prototype in uox3.h had only two variables added the third variale int Addmitem.

modified:

- cleaned up some dirty code to prevent some compile warnings.
- changed mining(int s) to check for grave sights.
- changed mining(int s) to use a new spawnitembackpack() function.
- adjusted the messageing for mining to ask "Where do you want to dig?".

new features:

- Grave digging is in, My first part in implementing my ideas for Necromancy.
	Use a shovel or pickaxe on a grave sight. It's not fully complete but it will spawn undead.
- new functions:
	SpawnItemBackpack(int s, int nAmount, char* cName, int nStackable, char cItemId1, char cItemId2, char cColorId1, char cColorId2)
	SpawnItemBackpack(int s, int nItem) -> Needs a lot of work it creates a world item but, doesn't draw it put it where i want it yet.

**also packaged this release with sensible scripts 1.07, due to tons of requests**
=============================================================================================================================================

UOX3 v0.68.025.027b released by Genesis <kccarter@uswest.net> - 11/06/98

=============================================================================================================================================
UOX3 v0.68.025.028 released by Gerry <gerry@nycap.rr.com> - 11/7/98

This release would not be possible without of course CIRONIAN and everyone else that has helped with uox3 in any way :)

Fixes, Modifications and New Features in this release were done by:
Gerry, Tauriel, SpaceDog, Myca, Bud, Armageddon, Cironian, Dupois

Bug Fixes : 
-Fix from SpaceDog, rem'd out, it caused problems with Tweak(and possible other code as well, if compiled under mingw32),
  rem'd lines are all of type bpitem[20]=items[i].decaytime=0;  (Bud)
-Fix for endmessage() showing wrong amount of time til shutdown
-Fix for no bottle being left when drinking a potion (thanks to Armageddon for the code)
-Fix for meat not getting destroyed when failing cooking, It will now remove a random amount up to the full stack.
-Fix for Decaying not getting reset when items are moved to the backpack
-Fix for newbie items getting deleted when trying to pile them(they will now stack)
-Fix for walking through stuff (by Cironian)
-Fix for the time returned when minutes are between 45-60 that was incorrect
-Fix to delete death robes that were generated for npc's in deathstuff(Bud)
-Fix for HP Regeneration Bug. (Mana Regeneration is based on armour mage is wearing, more armour slower regen)
-Fix for TACTICS not increasing when using training dummys (increases now, but only by a fraction of the normal rate - due to the fact 
 that 4 skills can raise TACTICS fencing,wrestling,swordsmanship,mace fighting).
-Fix for teleporting guards.  Wouldn't be summoned on spawned npc's that never moved after being placed such as SSCP's vendors or a newly
 placed NPC (reason being that chars[x].region was never updated until after the NPC moved - modified addrespawnnpc()).  
 NOTE - If you've used SSCP, all existing vendors will have to be removed and respawned in order to work 
 (or set their NPCWANDER = 4 to make them move).

Modified Stuff:
-Added timed checking for gatedestruct and respawn in main loop to help with performance.
-Fix checkweight() in walking code to not check if an NPC, GM or counselor makes it run a LOT faster.
-Training dummies now use tempeffect2 (removed from main loop to only check if their hit)
-Mining, lumberjacking, and fishing now possible on GM created tiles
-Moved newbie code from uox3.cpp to newbie.cpp
-All item and char structs in memory are now static..no more memcpy's on items or npc's..instead there is a new free tag, 
 did this so pointers can easily be used..also char serial numbers of deleted chars are now recycled when new ones are 
 created.(Bud, thanks to Armageddon and Tauriel for ideas we discussed)

New Features:
-Added Cironians monster gates(type 82, set morex to npc number)(Bud)
-Added flag for not showing death animations (server.scp SHOWDEATHANIM 1 or 0)
-Buffer system for creating new items and chars, in deleted memory spots is inplace.(Bud)
-Message saying when people enter and leave a server.
-Ability to set an archive directory for the uox3.wsc file.  Just before the world is saved, the old UOX3.WSC files is renamed and placed 
 into the directory specified by a parameter in the SERVER.SCP file.  To create the entry in the SERVER.SCP file, start UOX3 and then shut
 down UOX3 and look at SERVER.SCP.  There should be an entry called ARCHIVEPATH.  If ARCHIVEPATH is blank then no archiving will take place.
 To specify a location to archive the wsc file, enter a path such as ARCHIVEPATH C:\ARCHIVE\ (notice the ending backslash, it is required). 
 The file name will be in the form: uox3-yyyydddhhmmss.wsc  yyyy=4 digit year, ddd=3 digit day of year, etc...  Default is NO archiving.
-Added ANIMALS_GUARDED to SERVER.SCP.  If set to 1, and animals are attacked in a guarded region, well... then guards will be summoned.  
 If set to 0, then guards will not be summoned (like OSI-UO).  Default is NOT guarded. 

=============================================================================================================================================

UOX3 v.68.025.028b released by Genesis <genesispro@uswest.net> - 11/08/98

Bugs:
- In beggingtarget() the line for(i=0;i<charcount-1;i++) would not select npc with id 3.
	changed for(i=0;i<charcount;i++) 

modified:
- merged the code of .27b with .28a.

new feature:
- void Karma(int s, int nPierLimit, int nEffect)
	this function will modify the karma value of any character
	(int s) - current character.
	(int nPierLimit) - The karma pier a value between -10000 and 10000.
	(int nEffect) - 	value of 0 is used for a negative action.
				value of 1 is used for a positive action.
=============================================================================================================================================

UOX3 v.68.025.028c released by Tauriel <karl@mwcyber.com> - 11/08/98

Bugs:
- Fixed gravedigging code to compile under Mingw32. C'mon guys, make your stuff standard! 

modified:
- Commented out some calcweight() stuff (it was taking 10 minutes just to sign on a character)
  I know this probably causes some weight problems, but the looping within looping within looping
  checking for weight for all items was making it impossible to do anything.
- Anthracks added a lot of stuff to this release, his changes are in the \docs directory
  in the file Anthracks28c.txt

Note:
   This will be my last update for UOX3 for awhile.  It has become extremly obvious that without
the re-write of the way items arrays are handled, that uox3 will never become anything more than a toy.
That is why I will be starting with this version and trying to isolate all the item stuff and put it into
a single place.  This will allow easy creation and maintenance of pointer arrays for items.  I will be 
merging in features from other releases as I work on this. And I will release it when I get done. :)

=============================================================================================================================================

UOX3 v0.68.026.00 released by Cironian <cironian@stratics.com> - 11/09/98

Fixes:
- /NEXT command now sets the call you arrive to as handled
- Range checking for archery buttes is now more generous
- Stopped UOX from halting if no UOX3.WSC was found, blank world used instead
- Another walking fix; non-GMs wont be able to run through everything anymore
- Small fix to house deed targetting, someone must have broken it recently
- Fix to default UOX3.INI (Read the note below)
- Fix for backpacks still displaying deleted items (From the new delete code)

Changes:
- MoreX/Y/Z now added to /istats output
- Made /POINT a public command as it is often used to fix small problems
- Same for /WHERE; cant do any harm having it available to players
- items.txt removed from distribution as it made the archives too big

New features:
- Nothing really new, unless you count the finally working houses as such :)

Other:
- Sensible Scripts 1.08 included

NOTES:
The old default copy of UOX3.INI had the entries for MULTI.MUL and MULTI.IDX
in the wrong order, which might have accounted for a great amount of stability
issues when dealing with houses. The right order is to have MULTI.MUL as the
first of the two, followed then by MULTI.IDX (I spent 2 hours searching for
a bug in the code until I found that *grr*)

For the new house code, only small houses are working for now. Well, the
other deeds "work" but they dont automatically add doors and the sign yet.
I will add more tomorrow and just release new house.cpp files as that will
make the changes easy to implement for everyone else. (I just hope no one
else decides to suddenly start on house.cpp too after all this time)

- Script Teams 21a was updated to 22 by Genesis and Ripper. (Beware the slimes!)
- Almost all Item creation and deletion functions are now in items.cpp.
- Allow you to put privilidge settings in your npc.scp file by using PRIV1 X and PRIV2 X.
   (usefull for frozen corpsers , or magic reflecting Ancient Dragons. Make those guards invunrable) (Algaran)
- Shields have a chance to block 0 damage, thus no more insured zero-damage from small (Algaran)
   creatures while wearing shield.
- Armour no longer deducts a set number of points from damage done, it now reduces the total damage
   done by a percentage instead of by a set number 30AC recievs about 1/3 damage. This actually makes
   lower damage weapons/wretling usefull again (they did no damage before), and low level creatures
   will cause damage against armoured opponents (no more "invunrability)  (Algaran)
- A character with 0 dexterity will not become unfrozen when attacked. (usefull for corpsers, so they
   dont start moving in the middle of combat)  (Algaran)
- Gravedigging/mining Gem fixes, must use the new necro.scp  (Genesis)
- Made characters chars[].packitem = their packitem and int packitem(int p) now returns that. Should speed things up a bit.

New Features:
- Support for unicode speech!  Thanks Anthracks!
- Trigger system.  Makes almost anything possible now without adding code. See the trigger.html file.
    Thanks to SpaceDog and Zadius for working on this. :)
- Monsters can now be set to split when hit in combat (like slimes) see the splitreadme.txt for more info.

Documentation:
- Added the UOX Construction Yards command pages and updated them to be current. (Tauriel)
- An updated readme file. Thanks Ripper!
- Trigger.html Instructions for using the new triggers (by Zadius)
- Splitreadme.txt  for makeing monsters split. (by McCleod)

Pre-Testing:
- A special thanks goes to Ripper who found many major bugs and allowed us to fix them before
  26.06 went into "final" testing.

Updated Documentation

trigger.html - Trigger Documentation

Scripts Updated

items.scp - Item scripts
create.scp - Item creation menus


=============================================================================================================================================

UOX3 v69.00

   The entire way that items are looked up has been re-written. There are now several pointer arrays to items
   based on serial #, owner, container, spawner, etc...  Programmers should familarize themselves with the 
   pointer.cpp file.
   
New Files added:
   pointer.cpp, WorldMain.cpp, WorldMain.h
   
New Commands:
   /announceon  -turns on broadcast of world save messages
   /announceoff -turns off broadcast of world save messages
   
New features:
   Color coded messages (thanks Ripper)
   World saves seperated getting ready for binary saves (Thanks EviLDeD)
   Cutting bolts of cloth now leave cut cloth (Thanks EviLDeD)
   
Fixed:
   /guardson & /guardsoff  - now work properly
   To much more to list... after 2 weeks of coding and debugging, it should work whatever it was.

Broken:
   Background sounds for some critters (like sewer rats) would crash the server if you were
   not the first character on the first account.  Maybe one of the other programmers could
   figure this out.  I commented out the xsend(s, sfx, 12, 0);  for now... and it stopped the
   random crashes.

Script Stuff:
   Check the uoxscriptupdate.txt file.  There were some fixes that Ripper made to items, npc, and speech.
   
This should be the fastest that UOX has ever ran (except walking that still is slow), I hope you all 
enjoy it.  And walking lag will be fixed sometime in the near future...

=============================================================================================================================================

UOX3 v69.01 - Tauriel and the UOX Dev Team

   This release is mostly bug fixes, and speed improvements. There were numerous memory corruption errors
   and other crash type bugs that were fixed.
   
New Files added:
   none
   
New Commands:
/tile

	/tile xx yy	   , and clicking two points on a map, fills the box
			formed by the coordinates with the item specified by
			"xx yy".  The height of all the items will be the
			height of the *second* point clicked.  Note that this
			is *not* the item number that appears in the items.scp
			file, but rather the ID number (as seen in InsideUO).

/wipe

	The /wipe command has been altered from versions previous to 69.01.

	/wipe		   , and clicking two points on a map, allows the
			removal of all items within the box formed by the two
			coordinates.  This does not count items on characters
			inside the box.

	/wipe ALL	   clears ALL items from the game.  This is equivalent
			to the original /wipe command.  Note that 'ALL' must be
			in uppercase.  This does not count items on characters.

	/wipe x1 y1 x2 y2  wipes out all the items within the specified corners
			of (x1,y1) and (x2,y2).  Again, this does not count
			items on characters.

/iwipe

	/iwipe		   , and clicking two points on a map, allows the
			removal of all items **NOT** within the box formed by
			the two coordinates (this is an INVERTED wipe).  This
			does not count items on characters outside the box.

	/iwipe x1 y1 x2 y2  wipes out all the items **NOT** within the
			corners of (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) does not count items on characters.
			   
New features:
   
Fixed:
   /guardsoff  - now means exactly that, guards won't come no matter what, evil creatures, PvP, PvNPC, etc.
   Reveal was modified to use your magery skill when determining how far to reveal,
   and also takes into account z position (thanks Pellinore Dragon)
   Background sound crashing has been fixed.
   A lot of warnings were cleaned up (about 600 so far) about 400 to go...
   Vendors not responding to players sometimes.
   Vendor inventories getting messed up. (I hope this is fixed, it worked on test system).
   Another speed boost.
   Too much more other stuff to mention...
   

Broken:
	Monster gates are broken... not sure why yet, just found out about it. They should be fixed in 69.02.
	Some third party software (we won't name which one) wreaks havok on the shards. We are working on a
	fix for this.

Script Stuff: v. 24
   Check the uoxscriptupdate.txt file.  There were some fixes that Ripper made to items, npc, and speech.
   
This again should be the fastest that UOX has ever ran (except walking that still is slow), I hope you all 
enjoy it.  And walking lag is being worked on as well as Line of Sight and other things...
=============================================================================================================================================

UOX3 v69.02 - Tauriel and the UOX Dev Team

   This release is mostly bug fixes, and features.  The next release will be
   solely file format changes and bug fixes.  Then the long awaited SPEED boost
   will be in 69.04.  EviLDeD is in charge of the 69.03 release, and Crwth the 69.04.
   
New Files added:
   house.scp
   
New Commands:
/wholist  (by Homey)

	/wholist is a GM tool. It lists the players on-line and
			allows you to perform certain GM options on them, like
			teleport to them, bring them to you, jail, release, kick.
			It works very well, try it out.
			   
New/Fixed features:
	 Explosion potions now work you have 3 seconds to get rid of it.
	 
	Explosion potions were re-written. (Tauriel)
	sleep(20) was added back in to return some system resources for
	   NT systems.  (Tauriel)

	Stealing and Snooping fixes by (Crwth)
	Random and Area spawn fixes by (Tauriel)
	Line of Sight fixes by (McCleod)

	New /wholist command by (Homey)

		This is an awesome command... Try it out.

	More trigger fixes (Tauriel)

		Triggers will now give skill and stat gains properly.
		Well.... as defined in skills.scp.  Also added trees
		to lumberjacking in wtrigrs.scp

	Line of Sight (McCleod)

		No more arrows through walls!  No more fireballs from nowhere!
		This has been a greatly-needed addition, and thanks to
		McCleod, is now available!

	Healing Skill (Phantom and Wolfgang)

		Players with high-enough Healing skill can now cure and even
		resurrect other players!  This implementation does not require
		the Anatomy skill as on OSI shards.

	Unlockable Spawn containers (Phantom)

		A variant on the item spawning containers, these ones can't be
		locked by mean thieves for their own plundering.  This has
		been implemented as type 65.

	Guest Accounts (Zippy)

		For people running test shards, deathmatches or just open,
		public shards, this allows users to add a "GUEST 20" line in
		the accounts.adm file, which acts like entries for guest1
		through guest20, with the same password.

	House Placement (Zippy)

		Placing a house now checks for a valid position, taking away
		the ability to have pine trees sticking through the floor.
		Also, signs and doors and chests and things are now added
		automatically to your house, much better than before.

	Keyless door entry (Zippy)

		As long as the key exists in the user's backpack,
		double-clicking on a door will unlock, open, and relock the
		door.

	Explosion potions (Zippy)

		Double-click this, throw it somewhere, and boom!  There's no
		timer on it yet, so it explodes immediately;  strength and
		range-of-damage is determined by the skill of the alchemist
		that created it.

	Area spawners (Zippy)

		Type 69 allows NPCs to be spawned within a range of the
		spawner, and not just on it.  The range is settable with the
		more3 and more4 values:  more3=3, more4=5 means that the NPCs
		will spawn in a range of (-3,-5) to (3,5) around the spawner
		(where the spawner is (0,0) ).  It checks to make sure that it
		doesn't spawn them onto a tree or anything, too.

	Snooping/Stealing (Zippy)

		Snooping and stealing are back!  These should be working as
		you'd expect.  I don't know how guards would react, though...

	Trigger fixes and additions (Tauriel)

		Added tokens: RANDOM_ITEM, RANDOM_NPC, CMSG, END_TRIGGER  (see
		triggers.html for more info on them) Fixed HEA not checking
		invulnerable flag, Modified IDADD to be able to add a range of
		amounts. See gravedigging trigger for example of the new tokens,
		and wood chopping for new IDADD.

Script Stuff: v. 26a
   Adds a lot of fixes and changes. see the UOXScript readme

			(Note, this slows things down, and now it won't crash to the correct line in the debugger, it's nice and shuts down (with crash protection of 0.  Try/catch takes a 5-10% performance hit in C++, because of extra stuff it needs to track, you may want to not actually release a switch based version, but a #ifdef one, because even with a switch turned off, you will find that it still takes the performance hit because of what it needs to track... Abaddon)
			CRASH_PROTECTION added to server.scp SECTION SERVER:
				0 - Off, on an unhandled exception server will shutdown
				1 - Save only, on an unhandled exception server will save and shutdown
				2+  Save & Restart, server will save and restart on an unhandled exception, after
					10 restarts, server will shutdown.		(Zippy)
